Water Harvesting Training Module 2 
Part 1: Load and Display Water Harvesting Sites in GEE

This script was written as apart of the Training Program in ArcGIS Collector,
Survey123, Avenze Maps, and Google Earth Engine for Water Harvesting and 
Rangeland Management in Jordan developed by the University of Califoria, 
Berkeley in conjunction with Texas A&M University and the University of Florida.

// First, add the water harvesting site asset to the imports section.

// Rename the water harvesting site asset from "table" to a name like "WHS"

// Inspect the dataset. The print function writes information to the Console 
// tab over to the right.
  print(WHS);

// Add WHS to the map with the Map.addLayer() function, but first here is some 
// more information:

  /*The Map.addLayer() function requires a few pieces of information in the 
  following order:
  
    Map.addLayer(data, {color: " "}, name);
      - data:   this is the water harvesting sites, so it will be WHS
      - color:  this is where the color can be selected. It needs the curly 
                  brackets and color: to tell GEE to go in a change the color 
                  setting. 
      - name:   this is where the layer can be given a descriptive name to have
                  on the map.
  */
  
// Now try adding the water harvesting sites to the map.
  Map.addLayer(WHS, {color: "blue"}, "Water Harvesting Sites");
  
// Filter the water harvesting sites down to just one site. Look at Abata.
  var abata = WHS.filter(ee.Filter.eq("Hafeir_Nam","Abata"));

// Add abata to the map in the color magenta and label the layer "Abata."
  Map.addLayer(abata, {color: "magenta"}, "Abata");
  
// Center the map on Abata and zoom into it.
  Map.centerObject(abata, 16);
