# Jordan Water Harvesting Site Monitoring
I work as a GIS specialist for the Macaulay Lab at UC. I am currently contracted through August to help develop the Water Harvesting Training portion of the larger training program called ArcGIS Collector, Survey123, Avenza Maps, and Google Earth Engine Water Harvesting and Rangeland Management in Jordan. The Water Harvesting Training focuses on teaching basic GIS data management and introductory Google Earth Engine coding skills to employees of the Jordan Ministry of Agriculture in the Rangeland Management Directorate.

# Training Outline
The training to learn how to monitor water harvesting sites with Google Earth Engine (GEE) has three training modules.

1. Data Management

Data Management teaches employees how to get the Excel files they already have, properly format them to convert into shapefiles, and how to load those shapefiles into GEE.

2. Introduction to GEE

3. NDWI
